## ✏️ How to Customize the Number

1. **Open the `.psd` file** in Adobe Photoshop.
2. **Double-click the smart object layer** containing the number.
3. In the smart object:
   - Use the **Text Tool (T)** to change the number to your own.
   - If your number **includes a `0`**, **do not remove** the top-right stencil cross – it’s part of the official format.
   - Use **"Nova Square"** font if your number has `0`.  
   - For all other numbers, feel free to switch to a simple sans-serif font (like Arial or Helvetica) and **hide the stencil layer**.

> Save the smart object (Ctrl+S) to reflect changes in the main PSD.
